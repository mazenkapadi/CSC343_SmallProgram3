This is a sample file used for testing the fsgrep utility.
It contains multiple lines with different content.
The search term 'foo' should match lines containing it.
However, lines with 'Foo' should not be matched due to case sensitivity.
Some lines might have 'barfood', which should also be matched.
This line is here just for demonstration purposes.
End of file.
